# Constrained-MSapriori-Algorithm
modified Apriori Algorithm

MS Apriori is an extended version of Apriori algorithm to allow multiple minimum supports in data mining. In this the minimum support of a rule is expressed in terms of minimum item supports (MIS) of the items that appear in the rule. That is, each item in the data can have a MIS value specified by the user. By providing different MIS values for different items, the user effectively expresses different support requirements for different rules.
